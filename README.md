# Exploring the Cosmic History of Habitability
This repository will contain code used for my undergraduate final year project - using CAS variables (outlined in [Conselice 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJS..147....1C/abstract)) to quantify galaxy morphology and discover whether there exists a relationship between galaxy shape and presumed habitability. The habitability values were calculated using the methodolgy described in [Stanway et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.1829S/abstract).
